# Behaviorial Cloning Project

Overview
---
In this project, I employed an end-to-end deep learning approach utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to establish a direct mapping from the raw pixel data acquired from three front-facing cameras to the steering commands required for autonomous navigation of a self-driving car. The training process involved using a simulator to gather images during laps around a track, encompassing diverse scenarios such as varying turns, curb styles, heights, and pavement conditions. This robust end-to-end methodology demonstrates that even with limited human-provided training data, the system can autonomously learn to steer effectively, adapting to situations both with and without lane markings on the road.

The project will require submitting five files: 
* model.py (script used to create and train the model)
* drive.py (script to drive the car - feel free to modify this file)
* model.h5 (a trained Keras model)
* a report writeup file (either markdown or pdf)
* video.mp4 (a video recording of your vehicle driving autonomously around the track for at least one full lap)
